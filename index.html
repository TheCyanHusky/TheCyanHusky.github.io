        <h2>Button Masher:</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                Button Masher was a dive into the deep end for me and coding with javascript honestly for my first time using JavaScript I managed to make it work with little to no experience! It was a program that used multiple event listeners that check which direction the user is holding the joystick or a controller and if their holding it in the correct way as shown on the screen and press the a button their score will increased.

                Get to School [Definitive Edition] is a project in RPGMakerMZ that I'm working on! It's a reference to my Programming teachers project he had us partake in when first introducing us to coding with HTML and Flowcharts. This project has been discontinued but it is still available to the public. <br>
